# Eventify - Event Management System

Eventify is a web application designed to manage events, registrations, and attendance. It was built using **C#/.NET 9.0**, **React**, **Vite**, and **SQL Server**, following a **microservices architecture** with **JWT authentication** and **role-based access** for secure and efficient user management.

## Features

- **Event Management**:  
  - Admins can create, update, and delete events with full details (e.g., date, time, location, and description).

- **User Registration**:  
  - Users can register for events, and admins can track and manage attendee lists.


- **Role-Based Access**:  
  - JWT authentication ensures secure access, and role-based permissions determine what users can do (Admin, Organizer, User).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:  
  - React.js
  - Vite (for fast build and development)

- **Backend**:  
  - C#/.NET 9.0
  - ASP.NET Core (for API services)
